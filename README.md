## REST Countries API project! ðŸš€
This website is for everyone who want to check information about every coutry in our world! User also have access to switching between Dark and Light page mode and by finding country by typing in input or even sorting countries by select bar on right side. It's of course fully responsive on all devices!

:ghost: Which API I was using?
https://restcountries.com/

:dash: What I will do in the future?
I think there's nothing to improve on this website but maybe I will catch small bugs so I will fix them!

How it looks?
